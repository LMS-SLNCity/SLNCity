# 🏥 Lab Operations Management System - Complete Workflow Status

## 📅 Status Date: September 14, 2025
## 🔄 Latest Commit: `6c5f923` - Complete end-to-end workflow integration for all roles

---

## 🎯 **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: COMPLETE WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**

### **✅ PROBLEM RESOLVED**
The complete patient-to-test workflow is now **100% functional** across all roles. Previously, while patient registration worked, the ordered tests were not visible in phlebotomy and technician dashboards. This critical workflow gap has been completely resolved.

## 🔄 **COMPLETE DATA FLOW - END-TO-END INTEGRATION**

### **📊 Workflow Sequence**
1. **Reception** → Creates patient visit → Orders tests (CBC, Lipid Profile, etc.)
2. **Phlebotomy** → Sees patient in queue → Views specific ordered tests → Collects samples
3. **Technician** → Sees tests ready for processing → Processes samples → Enters results
4. **Admin** → Monitors entire workflow → Manages system configuration

### **🔗 Data Integration Points**
- ✅ **Visits API**: `/visits/**` - Accessible by all roles
- ✅ **Test Templates API**: `/test-templates/**` - Accessible by all roles
- ✅ **Test Ordering API**: `/visits/{id}/tests` - Creates lab tests
- ✅ **Patient Search API**: `/visits/search?phone=` - Phone-based lookup
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: All dashboards show live data
