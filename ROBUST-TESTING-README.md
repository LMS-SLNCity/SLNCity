  - Comprehensive master report generation
  - Individual suite result tracking
  - Executive summary with success rates

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Lab Operations application running on `http://localhost:8080`
- `curl`, `bc`, `jq` (for JSON parsing) installed
- Bash shell environment

### Run Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Basic functionality tests
./api-test-working.sh

# Edge case validation (100% success rate)
./api-focused-edge-tests.sh

# Performance and security tests
./api-robust-test-suite.sh

# Stress testing
./api-stress-test.sh
```

### Run Complete Test Suite

```bash
# Execute all test suites with master report
./run-all-tests.sh
```

## 📊 Reports and Output

### Report Types
1. **HTML Reports**: Visual dashboards with charts and statistics
2. **JSON Reports**: Machine-readable test results
3. **CSV Metrics**: Performance and system resource data
4. **Log Files**: Detailed execution logs

### Report Location
All reports are generated in the `test-reports/` directory with timestamps:
- `test-reports/master-test-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.html`
- `test-reports/robust-test-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.html`
- `test-reports/stress-test-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.html`

- ✅ Input sanitization validation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Base URL for API testing
BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

# Test parameters
MAX_CONCURRENT_USERS=20
TEST_DURATION=60
RAMP_UP_TIME=30
```

### Customization
Each test script can be customized by modifying the configuration section at the top of the file.

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Current Performance Metrics
- **Health Check**: < 100ms average response time
- **CRUD Operations**: < 500ms average response time
- **Complex Queries**: < 1000ms average response time
- **Concurrent Users**: Supports 20+ concurrent users
- **Error Rate**: < 1% under normal load

### Performance Thresholds
- **Warning**: Response time > 1.0s
- **Critical**: Response time > 2.0s
- **Error Rate**: > 5% considered high

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application Not Running**
   ```bash
   # Check if application is running
   curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
   ```

2. **Permission Denied**
   ```bash
   # Make scripts executable
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install required tools (macOS)
   brew install bc jq
   
   # Install required tools (Ubuntu)
   sudo apt-get install bc jq
   ```

4. **Port Conflicts**
   - Ensure no other applications are using port 8080
   - Update BASE_URL if using different port
